sample_1	Extraction	50 uL of sample was diluted with IS in MeOH, followed by 500 uL acetonitril. Mixture was vortexed and subsequently centrifuged at 16100*g at room temp. For 5 minutes. Supernatant was transferred to a new vial and evaporated at 37 degree Celsius under a flow of nitrogen. 50 uL of 1M derivitizing agent (1-butanol : acetylchloride 19:1) was added. The sample was vortexed and kept at 60° Celsius for exactly 15 minutes. Sample was again evaporated at 37° Celsius under a flow of nitrogen. Sample was then resuspended in 500 uL acetonitril, vortexed and injected.
