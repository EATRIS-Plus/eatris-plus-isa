Term Source Version																		
Term Source Description	A structured classification of molecular entities of biological interest focusing on 'small' chemical compounds.	CHMO, the chemical methods ontology, describes methods used to collect data in chemical experiments, such as mass spectrometry and electron microscopy prepare and separate material for further analysis, such as sample ionisation, chromatography, and electrophoresis synthesise materials, such as epitaxy and continuous vapour deposition It also describes the instruments used in these experiments, such as mass spectrometers and chromatography columns. It is intended to be complementary to the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI).	A classification of the diverse roles performed in the work leading to a published research output in the sciences. Its purpose to provide transparency in contributions to scholarly published work, to enable improved systems of attribution, credit, and accountability.	EDAM (EMBRACE Data and Methods) is an ontology of common bioinformatics operations, topics, types of data including identifiers, and formats. EDAM comprises common concepts (shared within the bioinformatics community) that apply to semantic annotation of resources.	The Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) provides a systematic description of many experimental variables available in EBI databases, and for external projects such as the NHGRI GWAS catalogue. It combines parts of several biological ontologies, such as anatomy, disease and chemical compounds. The scope of EFO is to support the annotation, analysis and visualization of data handled by many groups at the EBI and as the core ontology for OpenTargets.org	The Genomic Epidemiology Ontology (GenEpiO) covers vocabulary necessary to identify, document and research foodborne pathogens and associated outbreaks.	A structured controlled vocabulary for the annotation of experiments concerned with protein-protein interactions.	A representation of the variety of methods used to make clinical and phenotype measurements.	A structured controlled vocabulary for the annotation of experiments concerned with proteomics mass spectrometry.	MSIO aims to provide a single point of entry to support semantic markup of experiments making use of NMR and MS techniques to identify, measure and quantify small molecules known as metabolites. MSIO covers metabolite profiling, targeted or undertargeted, tracer based applications. MSIO reuses a number of resources such as CHEBI, DUO, NMRCV, OBI, and STATO.	An ontology representation of the NCBI organismal taxonomy	The NCIt OBO Edition project aims to increase integration of the NCIt with OBO Library ontologies. NCIt is a reference terminology that includes broad coverage of the cancer domain, including cancer related diseases, findings and abnormalities. NCIt OBO Edition releases should be considered experimental.	An integrated ontology for the description of life-science and clinical investigations	An ontological version of MIABIS (Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing)	The PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database is a centralized, standards compliant, public data repository for proteomics data, including protein and peptide identifications, post-translational modifications and supporting spectral evidence.	STATO is the statistical methods ontology. It contains concepts and properties related to statistical methods, probability distributions and other concepts related to statistical analysis, including relationships to study designs and plots.	Uberon is an integrated cross-species anatomy ontology representing a variety of entities classified according to traditional anatomical criteria such as structure, function and developmental lineage. The ontology includes comprehensive relationships to taxon-specific anatomical ontologies, allowing integration of functional, phenotype and expression data.	tbd

Study Protocol Description							<i>Sample preparation:</i> To 50 uL plasma or serum were added 50 uL standard 1 (23.5 umol/L <sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>-free carnitine in H<sub>2</sub>O) and 50 uL standard 2 (10 umol/L <sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>-, 2 umol/L <sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>8</sub>- and 2 umol/L <sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>16</sub>-carnitine in acetonitrile). Samples were mixed and subsequently deproteinized with 500 uL of acetonitrile and centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was dried under nitrogen at 45°C, and subsequently derivatized in 100 uL butanol-HCl for 15 min at 60°C. Samples were dried under nitrogen at 45°C and redissolved in 300 uL of acetonitrile. Prior to injection, 70 uL of the acetonitrile containing the acylcarnitines was mixed with 30 uL H<sub>2</sub>O.		<i>Sample introduction and ESI-MS/MS analysis:</i> Free carnitine and acylcarnitines were measured using scanning for precursor ions of mass 85 from 200 to 550 Da during 2 min on a Micromass Quattro II triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer, using a Gilson 231XL autosampler and a Hewlett-Packard HP-1100 HPLC pump, essentially as described previously (Rashed et al 1995a, 1997).	<i>Calibration:</i> Calibration curves were obtained for free carnitine in the range 5-100 umol/L, for acetylcarnitine in the range 2-40 umol/L and for all other available acylcarnitines in the range 0.25-6 umol/L by adding standards to a normal plasma pool. All calibration curves were linear (r > 0.99, data not shown). For unsaturated and hydroxylated acylcarnitines an identical response to that of their saturated counterparts was assumed.
