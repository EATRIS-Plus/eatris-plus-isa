Term Source Version																				
Term Source Description	The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) describes biological screening assays and their results including high-throughput screening (HTS) data for the purpose of categorizing assays and data analysis. BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). BAO currently has over 700 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies. It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design, Detection Technology, and Endpoint. Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen). Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation). Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof. The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal. Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal. Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent inhibition, etc). BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays. All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation.	A structured classification of molecular entities of biological interest focusing on 'small' chemical compounds.	CHMO, the chemical methods ontology, describes methods used to collect data in chemical experiments, such as mass spectrometry and electron microscopy prepare and separate material for further analysis, such as sample ionisation, chromatography, and electrophoresis synthesise materials, such as epitaxy and continuous vapour deposition It also describes the instruments used in these experiments, such as mass spectrometers and chromatography columns. It is intended to be complementary to the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI).	A classification of the diverse roles performed in the work leading to a published research output in the sciences. Its purpose to provide transparency in contributions to scholarly published work, to enable improved systems of attribution, credit, and accountability.	EDAM (EMBRACE Data and Methods) is an ontology of common bioinformatics operations, topics, types of data including identifiers, and formats. EDAM comprises common concepts (shared within the bioinformatics community) that apply to semantic annotation of resources.	The Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) provides a systematic description of many experimental variables available in EBI databases, and for external projects such as the NHGRI GWAS catalogue. It combines parts of several biological ontologies, such as anatomy, disease and chemical compounds. The scope of EFO is to support the annotation, analysis and visualization of data handled by many groups at the EBI and as the core ontology for OpenTargets.org	The Genomic Epidemiology Ontology (GenEpiO) covers vocabulary necessary to identify, document and research foodborne pathogens and associated outbreaks.	A structured controlled vocabulary for the annotation of experiments concerned with protein-protein interactions.	A representation of the variety of methods used to make clinical and phenotype measurements.	A structured controlled vocabulary for the annotation of experiments concerned with proteomics mass spectrometry.	MSIO aims to provide a single point of entry to support semantic markup of experiments making use of NMR and MS techniques to identify, measure and quantify small molecules known as metabolites. MSIO covers metabolite profiling, targeted or undertargeted, tracer based applications. MSIO reuses a number of resources such as CHEBI, DUO, NMRCV, OBI, and STATO.	An ontology representation of the NCBI organismal taxonomy	The NCIt OBO Edition project aims to increase integration of the NCIt with OBO Library ontologies. NCIt is a reference terminology that includes broad coverage of the cancer domain, including cancer related diseases, findings and abnormalities. NCIt OBO Edition releases should be considered experimental.	An integrated ontology for the description of life-science and clinical investigations	An ontological version of MIABIS (Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing)	An application ontology designed to annotate next-generation sequencing experiments performed on RNA.	The PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database is a centralized, standards compliant, public data repository for proteomics data, including protein and peptide identifications, post-translational modifications and supporting spectral evidence.	STATO is the statistical methods ontology. It contains concepts and properties related to statistical methods, probability distributions and other concepts related to statistical analysis, including relationships to study designs and plots.	Uberon is an integrated cross-species anatomy ontology representing a variety of entities classified according to traditional anatomical criteria such as structure, function and developmental lineage. The ontology includes comprehensive relationships to taxon-specific anatomical ontologies, allowing integration of functional, phenotype and expression data.	tbd

Study Protocol Description			RNA extraction is a nucleic acid extraction where the desired output material is RNA		Library preparation from 800 ng of total RNA was performed according to Illumina stranded mRNA prep Reference Guide (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). ). Library quality check was performed using LabChip GX Touch HT High Sensitivity assay (PerkinElmer, USA). The libraries were quantified for sequencing using KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA).	Sequencing was performed with Illumina NovaSeq system using S4 flow cell with lane divider (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Read length for the paired-end run was 2x151 bp.		A protocol with the objective to transcribe single-stranded RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA)	An assay in which a set of microRNAs of a biological sample is analysed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)	Comparison of a variable factor to one with a fixed value (e.g., comparison of gene expression to a gene with constant expression)				<i>Calibration:</i> Calibration curves were obtained for free carnitine in the range 5-100 umol/L, for acetylcarnitine in the range 2-40 umol/L and for all other available acylcarnitines in the range 0.25-6 umol/L by adding standards to a normal plasma pool. All calibration curves were linear (r > 0.99, data not shown). For unsaturated and hydroxylated acylcarnitines an identical response to that of their saturated counterparts was assumed.
